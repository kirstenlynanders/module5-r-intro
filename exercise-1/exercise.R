# Exercise-1: practice with basic syntax

# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born
hometown <- "Phoenix"

# Assign your name to the variable `my.name`
my.name <- "Kirsten Anders"

# Assign your height (in inches) to a variable `my.height`
my.height <- (12*5) + 9

# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have
puppies <- 4

# Create a variable `puppy.price`, which is how expensive you think a puppy is
puppy.price <- 200

# Create a variable `total.cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies
total.cost <- (200*4)

# Create a boolean variable `too.expensive`, set to TRUE if the cost is greater than $1,000
too.expensive <- FALSE

# Create a variable `max.puppies`, which is the number of puppies you can afford for $1,000.
max.puppies <- 4
